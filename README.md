**Project Name:** Recipe Finder Web Application

**Description:**
The Recipe Finder web application is a unique and engaging project designed to help users discover new recipes based on the ingredients they have. By leveraging TheMealDB API and Babylon.js, this application combines traditional front-end development with 3D graphics to create a visually appealing and interactive user experience.

**Features:**

1. **Ingredient Search:** Users can enter an ingredient in the search bar to find recipes that include that ingredient. The application fetches relevant recipes from TheMealDB API.
   
2. **Recipe Display:** The fetched recipes are displayed on the webpage with images and names of the dishes. Each recipe is presented in an attractive card layout.

3. **3D Interactive Scene:** Using Babylon.js, the application creates a 3D interactive scene where each recipe is represented by a textured 3D box. Users can interact with the scene, exploring the different recipes in a unique way.

4. **Responsive Design:** The web application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices and screen sizes.

5. **Error Handling:** The application includes error handling to display appropriate messages if no recipes are found or if there is an issue with the API request.

**Technologies Used:**

1. **HTML:** To structure the web pages and create the forms and containers for displaying recipes.
2. **CSS:** To style the web application and ensure a visually appealing layout.
3. **JavaScript:** To handle user interactions, fetch data from TheMealDB API, and create the 3D scene using Babylon.js.
4. **TheMealDB API:** To fetch recipe data based on the user's input ingredient.
5. **Babylon.js:** To create and render the 3D interactive scene displaying the recipes.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Setting Up the Project:** Create the project structure with separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

2. **Creating the Form:** Design a form in HTML with an input field for the ingredient and a submit button.

3. **Styling the Application:** Use CSS to style the form, recipe cards, and 3D scene canvas.

4. **Fetching Recipes:** Write JavaScript code to handle form submission, fetch recipes from TheMealDB API, and display the results on the webpage.

5. **Building the 3D Scene:** Use Babylon.js to create a 3D scene with a camera, light, and 3D boxes representing the recipes. Apply textures to the boxes using the recipe images.

6. **Interactivity:** Add interactivity to the 3D scene, allowing users to rotate, zoom, and explore the recipes.

7. **Error Handling:** Implement error handling to display messages if no recipes are found or if there is an issue with the API request.

**Conclusion:**

The Recipe Finder web application is a creative and innovative project that showcases the integration of traditional front-end development with 3D graphics. It provides users with an engaging and interactive way to discover new recipes, making it a standout addition to any portfolio.
