# Recipe-Finder
The Recipe Finder web app allows users to search for recipes by entering an ingredient. It fetches recipe data from TheMealDB API and displays the results in a visually appealing 3D interactive scene using Babylon.js. This project combines front-end development with 3D graphics, offering an engaging and unique way to explore recipes. 🍲✨
